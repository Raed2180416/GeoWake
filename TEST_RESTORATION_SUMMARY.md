- Offline coordinator tests

### 7. Notifications (5 tests)
- Notification service tests
- Native actions and permission tests
- Pending restore tests

### 8. Location & Sensors (6 tests)
- Location rapid fire stress tests
- Sensor fusion tests
- Heading smoother tests
- Sample validator tests

### 9. Persistence & Security (9 tests)
- Persistence tests (corruption, recovery, write ordering)
- Secure token storage migration
- SSL pinning tests

- Tracking power mode integration

### 12. Integration & E2E Tests (6 tests)
- Adaptive journey integration tests
- Simulated route integration
- Tracking service integration (connectivity, reroute)
- Device alarm integration (in integration_test/)

### 13. Miscellaneous (5 tests)
- Lifecycle cancellation tests
- Widget tests
- Parity canary tests
- Metrics snapshot export

## Test Infrastructure

### Test Configuration (`dart_test.yaml`)
```yaml
concurrency: 1

tags:
  serial:
    description: Tests that must run serially (no special behavior configured).
```

### Test Setup (`flutter_test_config.dart`)
- Initializes Hive with temporary directory for isolated test execution
- Ensures proper cleanup after tests complete
- Prevents test interference through isolated storage

## Compatibility Notes

The restored tests were written for the codebase at commit `64980e7`. They may require updates if the codebase has changed significantly since then, particularly:

1. **Import paths**: Verify all import statements match current package structure
2. **API changes**: Check if any service APIs have changed
3. **Dependencies**: Ensure all test dependencies are properly declared in `pubspec.yaml`
4. **Mock objects**: Verify mock implementations are compatible with current interfaces

## Next Steps

To fully integrate these tests:

1. **Install dependencies**: Run `flutter pub get` to ensure all dependencies are available
2. **Run tests**: Execute `flutter test` to verify all tests pass
3. **Fix failing tests**: Address any test failures due to code changes
4. **Update tests**: Modernize tests if APIs have changed
5. **Add to CI/CD**: Ensure tests are part of the continuous integration pipeline

## Benefits of Restoration

- **Comprehensive coverage**: 111 test files covering critical application functionality
- **Regression prevention**: Helps catch bugs before they reach production
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation of expected behavior
- **Confidence**: Enables safe refactoring and feature development
- **Quality assurance**: Validates core functionality across the application

## Conclusion

All deleted test files have been successfully restored from commit `64980e7`. The test suite is now ready for integration with the current codebase. Further validation through test execution is recommended to ensure compatibility with any code changes made since the tests were originally written.
