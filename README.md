#GeoWake

GeoWake is a smart, location-based wake-up app that makes your daily commute stress-free.
Imagine never missing your stop again—whether you're taking the metro or driving—because GeoWake monitors your journey in real time and alerts you 
just before you reach your destination.

What It Solves:

    Missed Stops: Automatically alerts you when you're approaching your chosen stop, whether it's by distance or time.
    Ease-of-Use: Set your destination and preferred alert (like "wake me 2 minutes before I reach my stop") and let the app do the rest.
    Accurate Tracking: Uses a combination of on-device GPS and smart API calls to deliver accurate predictions—even if you lose connectivity underground.
    Battery Efficiency: GeoWake smartly adjusts its location update frequency based on your battery level, ensuring minimal drain while you travel.

How It Works (In Brief):

    Destination & Settings: Enter your destination via an intuitive search interface. Choose whether you want an alert based on time (minutes) or distance (kilometers).
    Real-Time Monitoring: The app continuously tracks your location and compares it to your planned route.
    Smart Alerts: When you’re about to reach your stop, GeoWake sends you a local notification—no need to constantly check the map.
    Offline Reliability: Even if you lose connection (like underground), the app uses cached route data and on-device computations to keep you informed.

GeoWake makes your commute easier by letting you enjoy your journey, without the hassle of waking up too early or missing your stop.
