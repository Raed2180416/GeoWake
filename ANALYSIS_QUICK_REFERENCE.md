## 🎓 For Developers

### Architecture Strengths
- ✅ Service-oriented design
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Intelligent caching
- ✅ Background isolate

### Architecture Weaknesses
- ⚠️ God object (TrackingService)

## 💼 For Management

### Business Impact

**Risk of Proceeding Now**:
- User churn from reliability issues
- Negative reviews (alarm doesn't fire)
- Privacy violation liability
- Support cost increase

**Benefit of Fixing First**:
- Stable platform for features
- Positive user experience
- Scalable foundation
- Professional quality

### Investment Required

**Time**: 8-12 weeks  
**Budget**: $25,000 - $35,000  
**Team**: 2 Flutter devs + 1 Android + 1 QA

**ROI**: Prevent churn, enable monetization, reduce support costs
