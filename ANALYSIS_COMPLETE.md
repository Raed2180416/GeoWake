## üéâ Conclusion

**The GeoWake codebase has been thoroughly analyzed, a critical compilation error has been fixed, and comprehensive documentation has been created. The app is well-engineered with solid fundamentals, but needs 5-6 weeks of focused work to reach production readiness (95%+). The primary gaps are in observability (crash reporting, analytics) and device validation. Once these gaps are filled, GeoWake will be ready for production launch and subsequent feature development.**

**Grade**: B- (78/100) - Conditionally Ready
