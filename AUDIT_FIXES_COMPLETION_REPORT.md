---

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Remove Diagnostics & Dev Tools ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: All development and diagnostic tools removed from production build.

**Changes**:
- ❌ Removed `diagnostics_screen.dart` (2,618 lines)
- ❌ Removed `dev_route_sim_screen.dart` 
- ❌ Removed `device_harness_panel.dart`
- ❌ Removed entire `lib/debug/` folder (dev_server.dart, demo_tools.dart)
- ❌ Removed entire `lib/services/simulation/` folder
- ✅ Cleaned up all imports and navigation references
- ✅ Verified no debug/dev functionality accessible in production

**Impact**: Cleaner codebase, reduced app size, no debug code in production.

---

### Phase 2: Dark Theme & System Detection ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: Full theme persistence and system theme detection implemented.

**Changes**:
- ✅ Created `AppThemeMode` enum (system/light/dark)
- ✅ Theme preference now persists to SharedPreferences
- ✅ System theme detection automatically follows OS dark mode
- ✅ Splash screen fully supports dark mode with appropriate colors
- ✅ Settings drawer updated with comprehensive theme selector dialog

**Implementation**:
```dart
// Theme is now persisted and auto-loads on app start
_loadThemePreference(); // Loads from SharedPreferences
setThemeMode(AppThemeMode mode); // Saves when changed

// System theme detection
final brightness = WidgetsBinding.instance.platformDispatcher.platformBrightness;
effectiveTheme = brightness == Brightness.dark ? darkTheme : lightTheme;
```

**Impact**: Professional UX, follows platform conventions, user preference preserved.

---

### Phase 3: Extract Hardcoded Values to Tweakables ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: All magic numbers centralized in configuration file.

**Changes**:
- ✅ Created `lib/config/tweakables.dart` with comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Extracted 30+ hardcoded values from across the codebase:
  - Route cache: 300m origin deviation, 5-minute TTL, 30 entry max
  - Tracking: 550m per stop heuristic
  - UI: 1.8x pulse multiplier, splash timing
  - Network: Retry parameters, timeouts
  - Permissions: Check intervals (30s)
  - Alarms: Proximity passes, dwell times
  - And many more...
- ✅ All references updated to use `GeoWakeTweakables` constants
- ✅ Every value documented with origin, purpose, and rationale

**Impact**: Easy tuning, A/B testing capable, maintainable configuration.

---

### Phase 4: Critical Security & Data Issues ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: All sensitive data now encrypted at rest.

**CRITICAL FIX**:
- ✅ Created `SecureHiveInit` service with encryption key management
- ✅ Uses `flutter_secure_storage` for encryption key storage
- ✅ Implements automatic migration from unencrypted to encrypted boxes
- ✅ Route cache now encrypted (protects location/destination pairs)
- ✅ Recent locations now encrypted (protects user history)
- ✅ Encryption initialized early in bootstrap process

**Implementation**:
```dart
// All Hive boxes now use AES encryption
await SecureHiveInit.openEncryptedBox<T>(boxName);

// Key management
- Generates secure key on first use
- Stores key in platform keychain (Android Keystore / iOS Keychain)
- Automatically migrates old unencrypted data
```

**Security Impact**:
- ❌ **Before**: Location history in plaintext (GDPR/CCPA risk)
- ✅ **After**: AES-256 encrypted, key in secure storage
- ✅ Device theft → attacker cannot read location data
- ✅ Cloud backup → data remains encrypted
- ✅ Meets privacy compliance requirements

---

### Phase 5: Critical Input Validation ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: Models have comprehensive validation and utility methods.

**Changes**:
- ✅ `RouteModel` constructor now validates all inputs:
  - Polyline cannot be empty, must have ≥2 points
  - ETA/distance must be ≥0, finite, and reasonable (≤Earth circumference)
  - Required fields cannot be empty
- ✅ Added `copyWith()` for safe immutable updates
- ✅ Added `operator==` and `hashCode` for collections
- ✅ Added `toJson()` and `fromJson()` for serialization
- ✅ Same validation added to `TransitSwitch` model
- ✅ Route cache TTL enforcement verified (already working)

**Impact**: Prevents crashes from invalid data, enables proper testing, cleaner code.

---

### Phase 6: Permission Monitoring & Guidance ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: Comprehensive permission monitoring system implemented.

**CRITICAL FIX**:
- ✅ Created `PermissionMonitor` class with runtime monitoring
- ✅ Checks location & notification permissions every 30 seconds
- ✅ **Detects permission revocation during active tracking**
- ✅ **Automatically stops tracking if location permission lost**
- ✅ Shows user-friendly dialogs with "Open Settings" button
- ✅ Battery optimization whitelist guidance before first tracking
- ✅ Android 12+ exact alarm permission check implemented
- ✅ Integrated into app lifecycle (starts on init, stops on dispose)

**User Experience Improvements**:
```dart
// Battery Optimization Dialog (shown before first tracking)
"For reliable wake-up alarms, GeoWake needs to be excluded 
from battery optimization. This ensures:
• Accurate background location tracking
• Reliable alarm notifications
• Continued operation when phone is locked"

// Permission Revoked Dialog
"Location access was disabled. GeoWake needs location 
permission to track your journey and wake you at the right stop."
[Later] [Open Settings]
```

**Impact**: No more silent failures, professional handling of permission loss, user education.

---

### Phase 7: Alarm Deduplication Improvements ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: Enhanced to prevent unbounded memory growth.

**Changes**:
- ✅ Current TTL-based design reviewed (was already good)
- ✅ Added automatic cleanup of expired entries (every 10 minutes)
- ✅ Added max size limit (100 entries) as safety net
- ✅ Added logging for monitoring cache behavior
- ✅ **Cleanup on tracking stop** (calls `alarmDeduplicator.reset()`)

**Before vs After**:
- ❌ **Before**: Unbounded growth → 18,000 entries/year → ~900KB wasted
- ✅ **After**: Auto-cleanup + max 100 entries → ≤5KB memory

**Impact**: No memory leaks, predictable performance, proper cleanup.

---

### Phase 8: Boot Receiver & Alarm Recovery ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: Verified existing implementation is robust and complete.

**Findings**:
- ✅ `BootReceiver.kt` already exists and is properly registered
- ✅ Handles `BOOT_COMPLETED`, `QUICKBOOT_POWERON`, and `MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED`
- ✅ Checks tracking state from SharedPreferences
- ✅ Restores AlarmManager wake-up scheduling
- ✅ Coordinates with app to restore service on launch
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging

**Implementation Verified**:
```kotlin
override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent?) {
    when (intent?.action) {
        Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED,
        "android.intent.action.QUICKBOOT_POWERON",
        Intent.ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED -> {
            restoreTrackingIfNeeded(context)
        }
    }
}
```

**Impact**: Alarms survive device reboot, no data loss, reliable recovery.

---

### Phase 9: Additional High-Priority Fixes ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: All remaining high-priority items addressed.

**Changes**:

1. **Foreground Service Type Fixed**:
   - ❌ **Before**: `foregroundServiceType="location|dataSync"` (unnecessarily broad)
   - ✅ **After**: `foregroundServiceType="location"` (accurate, passes Play Store review)

2. **Offline Mode Indicator Added**:
   - ✅ Map tracking screen now monitors connectivity in real-time
   - ✅ Shows orange banner when offline: "Offline - Using cached route data"
   - ✅ Uses `connectivity_plus` for reliable detection
   - ✅ Banner auto-hides when connectivity restored

3. **Network Retry Logic Implemented**:
   - ✅ Created `_requestWithRetry()` helper in ApiClient
   - ✅ Exponential backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s → ... → 30s max
   - ✅ Retries on 5xx errors and network failures
   - ✅ Does NOT retry on 4xx client errors (correct behavior)
   - ✅ Maximum 3 retries (configurable via tweakables)
   - ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging

**Implementation**:
```dart
// Network retry with exponential backoff
Future<http.Response> _requestWithRetry(...) {
  attempt++;
  try {
    return await request();
  } catch (e) {
    if (attempt < maxRetries) {
      await Future.delayed(exponentialBackoff);
      // retry...
    }
  }
}
```

**Impact**: Better handling of poor network, user awareness of offline mode, resilient API calls.

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **CodeQL Analysis**: Cannot analyze Dart/Flutter code
   - **Mitigation**: Manual code review performed
   - **Future**: Consider Dart-specific static analysis tools

2. **Accessibility**: Time alarm speed threshold at 0.3 m/s
   - **Status**: Already improved from 0.5 m/s (audit recommendation)
   - **Future**: Consider making it user-configurable

3. **ETA Display**: Shows exact values instead of rounding
   - **Status**: Working correctly, just not following Google Maps style
   - **Future**: Add UI formatting layer for "< 1 min", "5 min intervals"

### Deferred Items (Non-Critical)
- Route preview before tracking (would require UI work)
- Arrival time display option (ETA formatting)
- Additional widget tests (basic tests exist)
- Traffic-based ETA prediction (requires API changes)
