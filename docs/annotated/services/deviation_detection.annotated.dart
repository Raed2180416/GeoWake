}

// Post-block notes:
// - Nearest-point search operates on polyline vertices only; for higher fidelity, project onto segments.
// - Cumulative distance is approximate and recomputed when a nearer vertex is found; acceptable for coarse ETA/gating.
// - Deviation threshold policy is a placeholder; integrate with Dynamic ReroutePolicy bands for production logic.
// - Distance calculations use Geolocator for consistency with the rest of the app.

// End-of-file summary:
// - Provides building blocks to detect off-route conditions against a decoded route polyline.
// - Key methods: `findClosestPointOnRoute`, `determineThreshold`, and `isDeviationExceeded`.
// - Complexity: O(N) nearest vertex scan; cumulative distance sum O(N) in worst case when nearest vertex moves forward.
// - Extensibility: Replace vertex-only check with point-to-segment projection for precise nearest distance and progress.
