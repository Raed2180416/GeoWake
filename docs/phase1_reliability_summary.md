# Phase 1 Reliability Summary

Generated: 2025-09-28

## 1. Scope & Objectives
Phase 1 focused on hardening core navigation/session reliability primitives without large architectural rewrites:
- Authentication storm prevention
- Route cache integrity & bounded growth
- Deviation hysteresis correctness (no flicker)
- Lifecycle & race stability under rapid start/stop and deviation / reroute bursts
- Foundational corruption / eviction behaviors

## 2. New / Refined Test Categories Added
| Category | Representative Tests | Purpose |
|----------|----------------------|---------|
| Concurrency / Auth | `api_client_concurrent_refresh_test.dart` | Verifies single-flight token refresh under concurrent direction fetches |
| Cache Integrity | `route_cache_capacity_and_corruption_test.dart` | Ensures oldest eviction and corrupted JSON purging |
| Hysteresis | `deviation_hysteresis_test.dart` | Validates stable offroute/on-route state transitions & sustain timing |
| Stress (Burst) | `deviation_reroute_burst_stress_test.dart` | Multiple deviation cycles without duplicate reroutes |
| Stress (Lifecycle) | `orchestrator_dual_run_stress_test.dart`, `race_fuzz_harness_test.dart` | Rapid start/stop & multi-cycle orchestration resilience |
| Lifecycle Guards | `lifecycle_cancellation_test.dart` | Ensures metrics halt after stopTracking() |
| Tracking Integration | `tracking_service_reroute_integration_test.dart` | Sustained deviation triggers route switch or reroute policy |
| Snap / Spatial Accuracy | `snap_to_route_test.dart`, `snap_flags_control_test.dart` | Projection stability & absence of spurious flags in normal motion |

## 3. Instrumentation Improvements
- Structured logging (ApiClient, RouteCache) replacing ad-hoc prints for deterministic test assertions and easier failure triage.
- Monotonic metrics validation in fuzz harness (ensures no counter regress). 

## 4. Key Reliability Behaviors Now Guarded
| Behavior | Guard Mechanism |
|----------|-----------------|
| Single-flight auth | Shared in-flight Future + concurrency test |
| Early token refresh (no double refresh) | Concurrency test timing window |
| Cache capacity bounded | Oldest eviction test |
| Corruption self-heal | Corrupted Hive entry removal test |
| Hysteresis stability | Invariant-based deviation test |
| Lifecycle stop halts pipeline | Cancellation test (metrics freeze) |
| Reroute cooldown non-duplication | Burst stress + integration switch test |
| Race resilience (start/stop) | Fuzz harness multi-iteration run |

## 5. Residual Risks (See matrix & gap catalog)
No High severity risks remain. Medium risks: nuanced timing boundaries, multi-condition interplay (cooldown + queued reroute, sustain reset, retry exhaustion) and unexercised fault injection paths.

## 6. Metrics & Observability State
| Metric | Current Validation |
|--------|--------------------|
| location.updates | Monotonic checks post-stop (cancellation test) |
| reroute.decisions | Burst stress ensures no duplicate overlapping decisions |
| auth.refresh.count | Implicitly bounded by concurrency test |
| cache.entries | Eviction test ensures capacity constraint maintained |

Recommended Phase 2: introduce explicit metrics registry snapshot assertions & high-concurrency increment stress.

## 7. Coverage Gap Summary (Condensed)
See `tests_coverage_gap.md` for details. 17 enumerated gaps; 7 Medium - all tied to boundary conditions or fault scenarios requiring FakeClock or injected failures.

## 8. Recommended Phase 2 Workstream Ordering
1. Add FakeClock & timing boundary tests (sustain, cooldown, early refresh equality)
2. Fault injection: ApiClient auth fail sequences, RouteCache IO faults
3. ReroutePolicy cooldown overlap & queued events test
4. DeviationMonitor reset mid-sustain
5. Intensive metrics concurrency stress (10k increments / lifecycle ops)
6. Multi-alarm scheduling & notification debounce tests
7. Remaining low-probability corruption & boundary cases

## 9. Tooling / Infrastructure Enhancements Proposed
| Enhancement | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| FakeClock abstraction | Deterministic micro-timing assertions |
| Faulting persistence adapter | Simulate disk truncation / IO exception |
| Unified TestHarness (services factory) | Simplify injection of fakes & reduce boilerplate |
| Configurable fuzz iterations (env var) | Scale stress intensity in CI vs local |

## 10. Exit Criteria for Declaring Phase 2 Complete (Proposed)
- All Medium risks have direct deterministic test coverage.
- 100% branch coverage across DeviationMonitor, ReroutePolicy, ApiClient auth logic.
- RouteCache corruption tests include malformed, truncated, and oversize cases.
- Fuzz harness passes 10k lifecycle ops with zero metric regression or unhandled exceptions.
- No flaky test repeats over 3 consecutive CI runs.

## 11. Summary Statement
Phase 1 successfully converted previously implicit reliability assumptions into explicit, automated invariants. Remaining risks concentrate in controlled timing and injected-failure territory, making Phase 2 a focused instrumentation + boundary validation effort rather than broad refactoring.
