## Manual Testing Required ⚠️

### Scenario 1: Invalid Threshold - Distance Mode
**Setup**:
1. Open app
2. Select destination 2 km away
3. Switch to distance mode
4. Set threshold to 5 km
5. Press "Wake Me"

**Expected Result**:
- ❌ Error dialog appears: "Your alarm distance (5.0 km) is greater than the distance to your destination (2.0 km)"
- ❌ Tracking does NOT start
- ✅ User can adjust threshold and try again

**Status**: ⚠️ Needs manual verification

---

### Scenario 2: Invalid Threshold - Time Mode
**Setup**:
1. Open app
2. Select destination with 10 minute ETA
3. Switch to time mode
4. Set threshold to 15 minutes
5. Press "Wake Me"

**Expected Result**:
- ❌ Error dialog appears: "Your alarm time (15 min) is greater than the ETA to your destination (10 min)"
- ❌ Tracking does NOT start
- ✅ User can adjust threshold and try again

**Status**: ⚠️ Needs manual verification

---

### Scenario 3: Already at Destination - Distance Mode
**Setup**:
1. Stand at or very close to destination
2. Select that location as destination
3. Set 1 km distance threshold
4. Press "Wake Me"

**Expected Result**:
- ⚠️ Warning dialog appears: "You are already within 1.0 km of your destination. The alarm will trigger immediately. Do you want to continue?"
- ✅ Two buttons: "Cancel" and "Continue"
- If Cancel pressed: Returns to home screen
- If Continue pressed: 
  - Tracking starts
  - Alarm triggers within ~4-6 seconds (reduced gating)
  - Check logs show `startedWithinThreshold: true`

**Status**: ⚠️ Needs manual verification

---

### Scenario 4: Already at Destination - Time Mode
**Setup**:
1. Select destination very close by (1-2 min away)
2. Switch to time mode
3. Set threshold to 10 minutes
4. Press "Wake Me"

**Expected Result**:
- ⚠️ Warning dialog appears: "Your ETA is already within 10 minutes. The alarm will trigger immediately. Do you want to continue?"
- Same behavior as Scenario 3

**Status**: ⚠️ Needs manual verification

---

### Scenario 5: Normal Distance Alarm
**Setup**:
1. Select destination 5 km away
2. Set 2 km distance threshold
3. Press "Wake Me"
4. Start traveling toward destination

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ No error or warning dialogs (valid threshold)
- ✅ Tracking starts
- ✅ Progress notifications show
- ✅ When ~2 km away:
  - Multiple GPS confirmations collected
  - After ~8-12 seconds within threshold
  - Alarm fires

**Status**: ⚠️ Needs manual verification

---

### Scenario 6: Speed-Based Adjustment (Driving)
**Setup**:
1. Select destination 10 km away
2. Set 1 km distance threshold
3. Start tracking
4. Drive toward destination at 50+ km/h

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Tracking works normally
- 📊 Check logs for speed and effectiveThreshold:
  - When speed > 5 m/s, effectiveThreshold > configuredThreshold
  - Example at 15 m/s: effectiveThreshold ≈ 1.225 km
- ✅ Alarm should trigger when ~1.2-1.3 km away (not exactly 1 km)

**Log Check**:
```
AppLogger.I.debug('Distance check', domain: 'alarm', context: {
  'dist': distanceInMeters.toStringAsFixed(1),
  'threshold': 1000.0,
  'effectiveThreshold': 1225.0,  // ← Should be > threshold
  'speed': 15.0                   // ← m/s
});
```

**Status**: ⚠️ Needs manual verification with device

---

### Scenario 7: Speed-Based Adjustment (Walking)
**Setup**:
1. Select destination 2 km away
2. Set 500m distance threshold
3. Start tracking
4. Walk toward destination

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Tracking works normally
- 📊 Check logs show:
  - speed ≈ 1.4 m/s (walking)
  - effectiveThreshold = configuredThreshold (no adjustment)
- ✅ Alarm triggers at exactly 500m (no speed buffer)

**Status**: ⚠️ Needs manual verification

---

### Scenario 8: Edge Case - Zero Distance
**Setup**:
1. Select current location as destination
2. Try to set any threshold
3. Press "Wake Me"

**Expected Result**:
- ⚠️ Should show "already at destination" warning
- Distance should be ~0 meters
- May immediately trigger or show error depending on validation

**Status**: ⚠️ Needs edge case testing

---

### Scenario 9: Metro/Stops Mode
**Setup**:
1. Enable metro mode
2. Select metro destination
3. Set stops threshold
4. Press "Wake Me"

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Validation is skipped (metro uses different logic)
- ✅ Tracking starts normally
- ✅ Stops-based alarm works as before

**Status**: ⚠️ Needs manual verification

---

## Log Verification

### Key Log Messages to Check

1. **Threshold Validation**:
```
"Your alarm distance (X km) is greater than..."
"Your alarm time (X min) is greater than..."
```

2. **Already at Destination**:
```
"You are already within X km of your destination..."
"Your ETA is already within X minutes..."
```

3. **Speed-Based Adjustment**:
```dart
AppLogger.I.debug('Distance check', domain: 'alarm', context: {
  'dist': ...,
  'threshold': ...,
  'effectiveThreshold': ...,  // Should be > threshold when speed > 5 m/s
  'speed': ...
});
```

4. **Reduced Gating**:
```dart
AppLogger.I.debug('Proximity gating', domain: 'alarm', context: {
  'passes': ...,
  'dwellOk': ...,
  'needPasses': 2,              // Should be 2 when startedWithin
  'needDwellSec': 2,           // Should be 2 when startedWithin
  'startedWithin': true
});
```

## Performance Verification

- [ ] No memory leaks introduced
- [ ] No excessive CPU usage
- [ ] Background service remains efficient

- [ ] GPS usage remains within normal bounds

## Documentation Review

### Files to Review
- [x] ALARM_IMPROVEMENTS.md - Technical details
- [x] IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md - Overview
- [x] Code comments inline
- [x] Unit tests with clear descriptions

## Deployment Readiness

### Pre-Merge Checklist
- [x] Code reviewed
- [x] Unit tests added
- [x] Documentation complete
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Device testing with GPS
- [ ] Performance verified
- [ ] Security review passed
- [ ] All edge cases tested

### Post-Merge Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor crash reports
- [ ] Monitor user feedback
- [ ] Check alarm trigger success rates
- [ ] Verify no increase in battery complaints

## Notes

**Limitations Known**:
1. Straight-line distance used for "already at destination" check (not route distance)
2. Speed adjustment only for distance mode (time mode inherently accounts for speed)
3. Metro/stops mode excluded from threshold validation (different logic)

**Recommendations**:
1. Test on multiple device types (different GPS chipsets)
2. Test in various environments (urban, suburban, highway)
3. Test with different travel modes (walk, bike, car, train)
4. Monitor logs during first week of deployment
